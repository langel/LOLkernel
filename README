LOLkernel is a php/mysql website development framework focused on rapid development and restricted/shared hosting situations.  An intro doc is slowly coming together in tut.txt as I work a total refactor of the Firteen Electronic Content Engine System (the previous incarnation and currently running http://battleofthebits.org )

The main dev branch of LOLkernel is running at http://lolkernel.com
