/*


	M E H stands for

	MEdia Heuristics


	.htaccess looks for /meh/* fill calls 
	first it looks in /app/assets_media/
// XXX the following are not completely implemented!??! :U
	then it looks in /kernel/app/assets_media/
	then LOLkernel looks for controller /app/meh/meh.php
	lastly, this controller is ran and we get a 404



....orrrr

	we don't need this at all
	instead of /meh/ it could be /_m/
	all handled by .htaccess
	otherwise app runs and results in 404
